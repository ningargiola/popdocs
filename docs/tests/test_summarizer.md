# Test File: `test_summarizer.py`

This suite tests the **Summarizer** service, verifying its ability to generate summaries and extract key points from chat/message histories.

---

## Overview

**Purpose:**
- To ensure Summarizer formats and summarizes conversations correctly
- To validate the summarizer pipeline integration and behavior under mock conditions
- To check that empty, short, and multi-message conversations are handled as expected

---

## Key Fixture

- **`summarizer`**: Pytest fixture that patches the transformers summarization pipeline, tokenizer, and model for deterministic outputs and test speed.

---

## Main Test Cases

- `test_initialization`: Verifies that the summarizer pipeline is loaded and ready.
- `test_format_conversation`: Checks formatting of user and assistant messages for summarization input.
- `test_summarize_conversation`: Ensures correct summary is returned for multi-message input (mocked result).
- `test_summarize_empty_conversation`: Ensures empty conversation returns a clear default summary.
- `test_generate_key_points`: Validates key point extraction with mocked results and correct splitting into individual points.

---

## Usage

Run this suite to:
- Catch regressions in summary/key point extraction logic
- Verify robustness of summarization with real-world and edge-case input
- Confirm continued compatibility with underlying transformer pipeline
